  Example input: 
  I'm an apprentice at a company called tldraw, they make an open source developer library that helps people make applications based around a collaborative whiteboard. They also make an online collaborative whiteboard of their own, which is free-to-use and has features allowing a user to log in and save projects.I've also been working on an internal tool called a dev dashboard that tracks our github repos as well as social media engagement.
